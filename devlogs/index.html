      <p>
        So, about that November relase..
      </p>
      <p>
        This one is going to be really short. I don't really have an excuse for why it's taken so long for me to release this update, honestly just haven't worked on it.
        Honestly just didn't feel like working on it I guess, but this is what I get for forcing a release date on myself!
      </p>

       Even though it's gonna be a little late, I can guarantee a December realase, 100%.

        Guess who?

      <p>
        Lots of progress is being made! The game now automatically saves whenever the game is closed, meaning it is now possible to load your saved data!
        I also finally started working on some of the abilities and how they change the game. Blue is speedy, giving you faster movement, higher jumps, and a new air dash!
        Red is strong, giving you slight debuff in jump hight and speed, but giving you a ground pound and resistance to some hazards! There's also a new color, purple.
        It's not an ability, but rather a stun. If you get hit with a stun you turn purple for a short period of time, which stops you from moving at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to my save and load system I mentioned from before, it is now possible to earn trophies, and change settings! There aren't many trophies right now, 
        but I plan to add more trophies the further I get in the game. The options menu appears now, however it does not contain any options just yet. It will once I have
        polished up the menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also polished up my main menu screen, and there is an option for you to link a GameJolt account if you would wish to. Linking doesn't work right now, but it will in
        the future!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is my longest devlog to date, and I am very proud of the progress that is being made so far. High hopes for a November release!

        Yup, It's me again! It's been almost a month since my last devlog, so I wanted to give some updates on my progress <i>really</i> quick!
      </p>
      <p>
        I added a speedrun timer to the game to start giving the game other mechanics. I haven't worked on colored abilities just yet, however I have completely
        fixed my venting mechanic, and added a nice sound effect to it. I updated my controls to use the <b>Input package</b> so rebinding controls is not as big of a hassle.
        My progress has been admittedly slow, but I'm working whenever I can, with my last year of school starting up soon, I should be able to work more with the right
        motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope to have Demo 2 out before the November!

        Heyo! I'm still alive and still working on Slime Shift! Progress has been slow and I hate to admit that, 
        however I'd like to share the little bit of progress I've managed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I added controller support for all types of controllers, and a working menu screen. I've currently been working on a rework to my
        venting mechanic to make it easily readable, and more efficient. Again it's not much, but I wanted to say something before I went
        completely silent again.
      </p>

        Thank you for being patient with me!

        Hey guys! Been a bit since I last touched the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've decided I want to start the game from the ground up. I'm remaking all of my code, logic, and revamping my idea for the game.
        It felt like a platformer someone released for some views and I don't want my passion project to end up like that.
        Anyways, I wanted to share some of the ideas I had for Slime Shift's mechanics!
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought of giving the player abilities based on color as that was a main mechanic I was going to use for a Local Multiplayer mode.
        I don't have many ideas for abilities, but what I do have is the ability to break walls with dashes, unlocking secret areas or
        inverse graivty. As a way to keep the game balanced I wanted to add a limit to how many times an ability can be used before it is
        taken away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well that's all folks! See you guys in the next one!

      <h2>Website Devlog 5-26-25</h2>
      <p>
        Hey guys! so what do you guys think of the new website? Pretty cool huh?
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, Devlog! I added this lil' page here in order for me to keep up with updates and what not. So anytime I update something
        for one of my games, It'll be posted here first and then transfered onto other sites I use to publish my work.
        (eg. Twitter, YouTube, Discord, etc.) Below this post, I'll leave a special devlog <i>exclusive</i> to my site!
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for sticking around!
      </p>
      <p>
        P.S. <br>
        Forgot to say this, but Carrot does random things on the main screen :P

      <p>
        So it's been a while, huh? I wanted to at least do a little bit of work on this game so that I didn't just leave it to die.
        I ended up rewriting all of the character movement, which ended up breaking everything else. So at the moment I have gone back
        to square one. Sure, it might not be ideal especially since I had a bunch of mechanics fully implemented that are now broken
        but this gives me another chance to make things neater, and fix other problems I had with my character controller.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a more detailed list of changes,
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed wall jumping gravity being inconsistent</li>
            <li>Added a ground pound that is able to destroy boxes</li>
            <li>Removed entering vents due to a game breaking bug</li>
            <li>Unspaghetti-fied character movement</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, that's all I have for this devlog. I promise to work more in the future and fix-up my old mechanics.
        Thank you for your patience. It is very appreciated.
