      <p>
        Heyo! I'm still alive and still working on Slime Shift! Progress has been slow and I hate to admit that, 
        however I'd like to share the little bit of progress I've managed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I added controller support for all types of controllers, and a working menu screen. I've currently been working on a rework to my
        venting mechanic to make it easily readable, and more efficient. Again it's not much, but I wanted to say something before I went
        completely silent again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for being patient with me!

        Hey guys! Been a bit since I last touched the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've decided I want to start the game from the ground up. I'm remaking all of my code, logic, and revamping my idea for the game.
        It felt like a platformer someone released for some views and I don't want my passion project to end up like that.
        Anyways, I wanted to share some of the ideas I had for Slime Shift's mechanics!
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought of giving the player abilities based on color as that was a main mechanic I was going to use for a Local Multiplayer mode.
        I don't have many ideas for abilities, but what I do have is the ability to break walls with dashes, unlocking secret areas or
        inverse graivty. As a way to keep the game balanced I wanted to add a limit to how many times an ability can be used before it is
        taken away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well that's all folks! See you guys in the next one!

      <h2>Website Devlog 5-26-25</h2>
      <p>
        Hey guys! so what do you guys think of the new website? Pretty cool huh?
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, Devlog! I added this lil' page here in order for me to keep up with updates and what not. So anytime I update something
        for one of my games, It'll be posted here first and then transfered onto other sites I use to publish my work.
        (eg. Twitter, YouTube, Discord, etc.) Below this post, I'll leave a special devlog <i>exclusive</i> to my site!
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you for sticking around!
      </p>
      <p>
        P.S. <br>
        Forgot to say this, but Carrot does random things on the main screen :P

        So it's been a while, huh? I wanted to at least do a little bit of work on this game so that I didn't just leave it to die.
        I ended up rewriting all of the character movement, which ended up breaking everything else. So at the moment I have gone back
        to square one. Sure, it might not be ideal especially since I had a bunch of mechanics fully implemented that are now broken
        but this gives me another chance to make things neater, and fix other problems I had with my character controller.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a more detailed list of changes,
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed wall jumping gravity being inconsistent</li>
            <li>Added a ground pound that is able to destroy boxes</li>
            <li>Removed entering vents due to a game breaking bug</li>
            <li>Unspaghetti-fied character movement</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, that's all I have for this devlog. I promise to work more in the future and fix-up my old mechanics.
        Thank you for your patience. It is very appreciated.
