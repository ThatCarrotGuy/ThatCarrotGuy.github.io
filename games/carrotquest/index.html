                <p>One of my first games.<br><br>
                    Carrot Quest is a <i>very</i> short platformer game created by yours truly, and some other friends.<br> 
                    I had high expectations and it eventually became too big, and too much for me to handle. <br><br>
                    I <b><red>refuse</red></b> to finish or work on this game any longer, as It was merely a project for friends to enjoy. Never truly meant for the general public.<br><br>
                    I released it to the public anyways, in it's full unfinished state. I never saw any success from it, nor saw success ever coming from it. <br><br>
                    The version that exists for download here, is purely for archive purposes. <br><br><br>
