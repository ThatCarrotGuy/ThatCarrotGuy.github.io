Thanks for downloading Slime Shift!

This game supports Local multiplayer, and contains a hand-full of SinglePlayer levels!

Slime shift also supports mods! If you want to figure out how to create one, you can look at this doc 
here:

--This game was created using the Haxe coding language--
	     --Mods are created using Lua--

Sprites, Music, and Code by: 

                ---Carrot--

Anyways, Extras!

This game was originally supposed to be a PvP game created in Unity.
It was originally also titled Slim Gam as at the moment it was a working title. The build was never finished due to me being 
constantly burnt out for no reason, so I canned the whole thing and decided to re-brand it into Slime Shift!

Another old concept for this game, Magic Mages!
It sounded, and looked, very similar to Micro Mages (Great game btw) so that idea was scrapped as I don't feel like
dealing with comments that say shit like, "OOOH YOU STOLE THIS BLEH BLEH BLEH!"

Sooooo yea, that's that!

Thanks for downloading once again!
